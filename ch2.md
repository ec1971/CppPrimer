# key takeway
- avoid undefined behavior(e.g., asign out of range signed value to signed
  or implementation dependent behavior
- don't mix unsigned and signed. signed get to converted to unsigned

# string literal
- null character appende

# initialization
- initialization  & assignment NOT THE SAME THING
- default initialization
  - build-in type->undefied if local, 0 if outside any function

# declaration v. definition
- for variable, definition is declaration -> need to use extern to obtain declaration that is not definition
# compound type

```cpp
int *&r = p; //r is a reference to pointer to int.

```
